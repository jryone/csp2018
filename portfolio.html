  <p>This is a fun little maze game I made, I promise it's possible to beat it.</p>

    <p>This app works on Android, and it calculates GPA for eight classes. </p>

    <p>This is my flowchart in python, I made a flowchart on paper before typing out all the code. You can see all the code above.</p>

    <p> It can help add a tip, the tax, and to split the bill among any amount of people. It also asks you whether you are part of Gamberale's exclusive club, which gives you a ten percent discount.</p>
    <p> This program also calculates how much you are really paying if you use a credit card, which is two percent more, unless you use American Express, which is three percent. </p>
    <p> Lastly, it'll print a recipt for you. But enough of me explaining it - try it!</p>

    <h1>Image manipulation</h1>
    <img src="images/bob.png" height="500">
    <p> These are images of Bob Ross that I manipulated in python. As you can see, the first one is the original photo.</p>
    <p> The second one is cropped so that it just shows Bob's face. The third one is the same as the original, but with</p> 
    <p> red circles over his eyes. The last photo is similar to the original except that Bob's hair is magenta. </p>

    <h1> This is my example of a graph in python to answer the question:</h1>
    <h1> How has Trump's rate of tweeting changed over the years?</h1>
    <img src="images/trump_tweets_graph.png" height="500px">
    <p>If the image resolution is too low, the green bars are 2016, the yellow bars are 2017, and the red ae 2018. The y axis is number of tweets in increments of 100, and the x-axis is months in increments of one. </p>
    <br>
    <p>We used data from a secure <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/q22nq5he9xrvukc/trump_tweets.csv?dl=0">source</a> that listed out every one of Trump's tweets with data about times, dates, the actual message, and more. </p>
    <p> This answered our question of how Trump's rate changed over the years. Although it isn't the most clear because the years are all together, Trump has fluxuated quite a bit with no clear trend. </p>
    <p> Either way, it's interesting to look back and try to see which current events influenced him to tweet more or less, and I am happy with how it turned out. </p>
